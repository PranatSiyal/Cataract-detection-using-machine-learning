# Cataract-detection-using-machine-learning
Cataract detection using machine learning involves developing a model that can accurately classify images or detect the presence of cataracts in eye images
## libraries used
1. Pandas <br>
2. Numpy<br>
3. Matplotlib<br>
4. Seaborn<br>
5. Sklearn preprocessing, sklearn linear regression, sklearn metrics, sklearn neighbors, sklearn ensemble
## Evaluation
We evaluate the model using 
### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix is a tabular representation that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in a classification problem.<br>
It helps evaluate the performance of a classification model by providing insights into the types of errors made.<br>
The confusion matrix is typically presented in a matrix format, where the rows represent the actual classes and the columns represent the predicted classes.<br>
### Accracy Score
The accuracy score is a measure of how well a classification model correctly predicts the labels.<br>
It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.<br>
An accuracy score of 1.0 indicates perfect predictions, while lower scores indicate less accurate predictions.<br>
### Recall Score
The recall score (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the ability of a classification model to correctly identify positive instances.<br>
It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.<br>
The recall score provides information about the model's ability to avoid false negatives, i.e., correctly identifying positive instances from the total number of actual positive instances.<br>
